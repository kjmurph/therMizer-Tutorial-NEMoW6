__Workflow for running therMizer__  
This document describes the workflow for running therMizer for FishMIP 2022 ISIMIP 3a.  

This workflow happens in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).  

## Running a Simulation
The script `FishMIP 2022 Hawaii Region therMizer ModelRuns.Rmd` was used to run the requested scenarios as well as a 
validation scenario.

## Validate Output
The script `FishMIP_validation.Rmd` was used to validate the model output by comparing the size structure of modeled and observed catch.
The observed data aren't posted to this repository.  The data are number caught at size, with size classes matching those used in this
simulation runs.

## Final Products
This workflow results in the following files that are subsequently packaged as requested by ISIMIP:  
* `sim_steady_validate.Rdata`  
* `projection_steady_F.Rdata`  
* `projection_steady_noF.Rdata`
